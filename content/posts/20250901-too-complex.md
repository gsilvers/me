# Tools are annoying

I made a quick post yesterday, and it was so frustrating. I use hugo because it should be fairly consistent. I am publishing a blog, I host my resume and I don't even have a real hosting server to worry about, I "just use github pages".

Meanwhile I come back to the computer I last posted on. Hugo has updated, my theme is no longer compatible and the errors are obtuse. It takes me 15 minutes of googling/ai-ing and then fucking about to get a new theme and update my stack to test it locally. TO VIEW STATIC WEB PAGES?!?!?!?

Then I push to github and let my 50 line github action post it to pages... whoops that's broken as well. 

I know it was faster to set up than getting a virtual machine running in the cloud but man the tools we use and the debt we accrue to go fast even with personal projects is awful. We sort of lie about semantic versioning too. Hugo hasn't had a major version yet, so I guess minor versions can break. But oof.

I'm pretty close to just running apache somewhere and going back to 2001. It shouldn't take me being pissed 24 hours later to write a 5 minute blog post.
