# Can I post easily enough from my phone?

I would enjoy being able to write something small without being tethered to my desk. I’m trying a simple markdown editor from my iPhone and Working Copy. Let’s see if this simple post can make it online via GitHub actions. Typing on here is of course sub-optimal but it’s not so bad. The quick text corrections coupled with the cuddly dog outweigh the slow speed. 

# What else

For sure I will need to figure out a workflow for posting and uploading photos here. My most likely scenario would be posting a great photo while fishing.
