# This year...

Is almost over. I'm not sure how I feel about the time and myself and how we did together yet. I'm doing a bit of new years reflection early. Hopefully some preparation will help me make good plans or resolutions rather than desperate prayers which will go to the waste basket.

## What Went Well

- I did a ton more exercise than I've done in about a decade. I've ridden hundreds on miles on my bike and made a good habit of doing so. 
- I've done more for my health than I've done in decades. Between the above exercise, seeing doctors and improving my diet I'm doing better by my meat suit than I've done in a long time.
- I was able to cut down on cruft in my life. 
- I've been far more attentive to my partner, pets and family.
- I've partaken in far more group activities in cycling and gaming than I have in a decade.
- I've slowed down and listened to others more than trying to bowl my way throw everything head first.
- I've used Emacs nearly 100% of my coding time and I've reaped a lot of benefits in performance.
- I recorded notes, journals and just my ideas a lot more than before.

## What Did Not

- I still find myself spending tons of time checking click bait news and still logging into social media like Facebook rather than Mastodon or just not at all.
- I did not read nearly as many books as I would like.
- I've not made any "good" friends through activities yet.
- I've not been as frugal as I'd like.
- I've not blogged or created pixel art as much as I'd like.
- I've not slowed down enough and listened enough.
- I'm still not making as much time for the right activities for example cycling in the morning so I can get it in before things interrupt me.
- I still have not found a great way to capture non text notes.

## New Ideals

- I'd like to adopt literate programming in my day to day work as best as I can.


Overall I think this year was a big up swing. I'm looking forward to addressing some of the faults identified above but I'm glad to get started on this early so I can refine this a bit.
