# Pixel art games

So I've not written about this before but I'm hugely enamored with video games created with a pixel art style today. While I'm not against "big" games I do think its important to keep games accessible. I also really appreciate the detailed artwork and methods. 

# The feelz

As of late one of the methods I've been appreciating the most is the use of light. In the age of ray tracing GPU's its odd to do a study on pixelated lighting but here we are. Every time light and sharp contrast with the dark the feels come on for me. 

I find it amazing how the highlight color can communicate mood so well in these games. For example in this picture:

The image is essentially white, black and a deep blue with shades of each. The dark is not frightening in this case but rather tranquil. The slight white edging to blue highlights exudes calm and quiet. Which it does the scene is from [One Dreamer](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1156380/One_Dreamer/) which is a beautiful game and very much an exploration of someones memories both good and bad. In this case the game is sharing a contented memory of the past. An artifact of your friendships.

The lighting continues to tell a story as you learn about the llama:

The greens are used here in a similar calm manner but with a bit more edge or anticipation to it. As you would expect for the color of most life there's more energy here as you continue with the llama following you. The single orange tinted light source also hints of more to come. Again simple tricks of contrast and the beams of light traced by hand not by an RTX card give a sense of depth and a "roof" to the scene.

Later as you realize a failing light or lack of it can help explain sorrow:

The slight light of life peaking into a somber moment.

Games like one dreamer are really art in a new form and I'm glad to experience them. Everyone can have fun blasting away in a popular first person shooter but some of these hand drawn scenes should be in museums in the future. 

For now I get to poorly play around with the concept:

While these games bring me back to my early teens, remembering a walk through the woods in the evening, snuck away from parents, enjoying the moonlight.
