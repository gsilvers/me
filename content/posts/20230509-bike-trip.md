# Getting a start

I've found it difficult to get started blogging again. I want to convert over some of my old articles like my guide to using oracle wallets with dbeaver but the interest has been lagging. To get a move on I'm going to attempt to blog some more mundane items, but perhaps more fun to me.

## The end goal

I'd like to be able to complete a solo camping trip without using a car. By this autumn I would like to bike to a nearby campground, fish and camp all without a car.

## The trip

For the past two or three years I've been dealing with elevated blood pressure. On doctors advice I'm working in alot more cardiovascular exercise. Frankly its a fun excuse to spend more time outside fishing! In order to extend my roaming rather than jogging I've been cycling around. The increased distance is a great motivator for me, I can pick up dinner and try to catch some fish.

This Sunday I figured I would try to push the range further. I took a ten mile round trip. My origin is a bit obfuscated here for privacy but here's an idea. [Route](https://goo.gl/maps/NKxtcc14ZkJuZiDM6). 

The journey was fairly easy, my muscles ache the day after but while making the trip I enjoyed only speaking to others in passing and the sun on my face. 

## The view

The weather was sort of dreary with clouds but spots of sun. On my way out I was able to capture this snap of the Lehigh bending its way through the hills on its way to the New Jersey border.

On the way home I snapped this quick photo of the lock house along the canal.

## My thoughts

Being outside is a blessing and we value the wrong things. We need assets like the D&L trail to allow us travel without traffic. Instead we focus on highways and parking lots. While I hope to incorporate my exercise in more chores such as groceries, I really also hope to take time to enjoy my exercise in trips like this.
