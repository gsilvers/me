Lately I have been thinking a lot on what consumes my minds time. Specifically when I am consumed with things that I cannot or face insurmountable barriers too. 

# Worry

It seems we have a natural tendency to worry. One of the largest complaints about the modern internet is the incessant negativity. 

Why is that?

The same trends can be found in my day to day. I often find myself chasing goods to try to find panacea for some problem. I want emacs on my mobile. I want a laptop robust enough to take camping. There’s this belief that a perfect solution exists that will reduce the effort to none. 

Of course the perfect solution rarely actually exists and so we dwell on what we cannot have. Sadly short of hacks there is no emacs on my iPhone and it’s silly to expect a laptop to work equally well on my desk as on the side of a hiking trail.
