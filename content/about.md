# Who is this dude?

My name is Greg. I'm a software engineer, fisherman, dog lover and I try to ride my bike.

I currently work for the company [Health Verity](https://healthverity.com/) helping to enable analysis of medical data without violating the privacy of individuals. Currently working on [HV Audience Manager](https://healthverity.com/audience-manager/ "HV Audience Manager") which in short is a privacy complaint analytics environment. If you have questions about it please feel free to email me and I can get you in touch.

Greg dot silverstein at gmail dot com.

Previously I've worked with everything from [Credit Ratings](https://www.creditsafe.com/us/en.html "Credit Ratings") to [Brown Trucks](https://www.ups.com/us/en/global.page "Brown Trucks") with a few stops before and between.

# What kind of computer nerd am I?

I'd like to think of myself as a generalist but with a focus on teaching novices. I work a lot with data so I have a solid background in RDBMS's, Python, SQL and other tools like Databricks. I also have a growing fondness for lisp's especially Clojure and Common Lisp. I've also developed in Java, C#, C and even more obscure tool chains like [SAS](https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/foundation.html "SAS").

I do not really work on any big open source projects but I do have GitHub accounts.

I'm not really hunting for a new role at the time but I keep a short [resume](https://gsilvers.github.io/me/posts/resume/ "resume") here on my blog and have a [LinkedIN](https://www.linkedin.com/in/greg-silverstein-5104619 "LinkedIN").

I'm an Emacs user. Generally do my computing on some form of an apple laptop (although I'm writing this from a SteamDeck). I'm planning to try and get into basic game development over the next years and try to make a 2D game basically telling the life story of my dog. 

# What do I do outside of work.

Well, a few things. First and foremost I'm an overly involved helicopter dog parent.

Molly is about 11 or 12. She's a rescue and an absolute ball of joy. My partner Sierra and I spoil her rotten.

When I'm not feeding or picking up the result of said feeding I really get my zen one of three ways. I fly fish for trout pretty regularly. Due to some health complications I try to cycle a ton to keep my weight and blood pressure down. Specifically I try to mountain bike, and I do mean try. Green trails make my ass pucker. When the rain is out I tend to play video games, retro graphic styled ones mostly. I'm currently a big fan of Slay the Spire and Dwarf Fortress.

# What else

I'm a pretty easy going person but I tend to be pretty vocal about issues on education and technology. If you want to hear about how unethical Facebook or Google are I'm there. 

I'm really not easy going when it comes to the isms. If you're going to get on someones case about their race, genitals or really anything short of a felony I'm not with you. You're probably not my kind of human.

Other than that though I'm still a social butterfly, if you talk I'll listen and chat back doesn't matter what you're going on about. I'm really not active on much social media, I have been trying as of late [mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@pokeypoke).

If you think something here was helpful and want to throw some cash my way [pay up](https://ko-fi.com/gregsilverstein) 

See you around.
